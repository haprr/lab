# ODE-TO-CODE HACKATHON

A Virtual Hackathon 

## Selected problem statement number

      1

## Problem Domain

      Speech Analysis

## Solution to be demonstrated

      1. Creating a speech analysis module (Web Based) where certain questions such as
        below could be asked by the system(text form), and the specific intent of the
        answer should be displayed.

## Output Scenarios:

    For UI - output can be presented in any way.
    For API - Response 

    The output request response is demonstrated using API.

## Question SET:

    1. Do you suffer from any health diseases?
    2. Whatâ€™s your annual income?
    3. What is your dob?
 
 
## Requirements

      Flask
      Python Speech Recognition module
      We are using SpeechRecognition library of Python which provides Speech-to-Text Transcription service, Flask is used to take in the Audio transcript and create both a GET       and POST request on the different route.

## TESTING:

            We are using Postman tool to test our API.
            Method : POST
            URL : http://localhost:5000/api/all 

      Request Body:

            {
                "question_key":"q1",
                "options":["Diabetes","Thyroid","Cancer"],
                "audio":"" //encoded utf-8 audio text("I have Diabetes")
            }

            Audio text will be converted to JSON and stored in microphone-results.txt file.

      Response:

      If user answers : I have Diabetes

            {
                  "answer":["Diabetes"]
            }
Prerequisites:
  
       Postman tool - To send request to api
       Flask - install flask using "pip install flask"
       Speech Reccognition Library - install using "pip install SpeechRecognition"
       PyAudio Library - install specific version (based on your installed Python version and system configuaration(AMD / intel with 32/64 bit) of PyAudio wheel file.
   
Steps to execute:
      
       Make sure that both speech.py and api.py should be in the same folder.
       Execute only api.py using command "python api.py" in command prompt/or any Python executable environment by navigating to files directory.
